## License

Released under the **GPLv2** license.

---

## Overview

The plugin uses XMLTV sources to import EPG data into Enigma2.

Providers can find example XML source files in:

```

/etc/epgimport

````

These files can be used as a reference for creating custom EPG sources.

End users do **not** need to manually edit these files.  
All configuration can be done directly from the Enigma2 plugin menu.

---

## Installation – XML Sources

To install or update the XML source files, run the following shell command:

```sh
wget -q --no-check-certificate "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Belfagor2005/EPGImport-99/main/installer_source.sh?inline=false" -O - | /bin/sh
````
